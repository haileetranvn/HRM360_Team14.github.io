					<h2>Workplace Issues Details</h2>
					
					<h3>MYDAD's Issues</h3>
					<div class="issue-details">
					    <h4>Salary Dissatisfaction</h4>
					    <p>MYDAD expressed dissatisfaction with his salary, stating, "The salary could be better." Despite being overall happy with his work, salary dissatisfaction could lead him to seek other opportunities with higher pay, which may contribute to higher turnover rates within the company if other employees feel the same.</p>
					
					    <h4>Work Exhaustion</h4>
					    <p>MYDAD's focus on producing high-quality work is hindered by exhaustion. He explained that the nature of his work can be very exhausting, and being in a bad mood due to fatigue can lead to low-quality output. This indicates that work-life balance and preventing burnout should be a priority in order to maintain performance.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Vic's Issues</h3>
					<div class="issue-details">
					    <h4>Low Job Satisfaction</h4>
					    <p>Vic has a low level of job satisfaction due to a misalignment between his career expectations and the reality of his current work. He criticized his boss's outdated managerial practices, which further contributed to his dissatisfaction with his job.</p>
					
					    <h4>Lack of Intrinsic Motivation</h4>
					    <p>Vic's low job satisfaction led to a lack of intrinsic motivation. He expressed that he no longer finds his work engaging or meaningful, and his primary motivation for continuing his job is "to pay the bills." This shows a shift towards external motivation, rather than personal or intrinsic fulfillment from his work.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Boomshakalaka's Issues</h3>
					<div class="issue-details">
					    <h4>Salary Dissatisfaction</h4>
					    <p>Boomshakalaka's primary issue is salary dissatisfaction. He feels that his salary does not reflect the value he brings to the job, which could lead to frustration and the potential for higher turnover rates if not addressed.</p>
					
					    <h4>Role Misalignment with Personality</h4>
					    <p>Boomshakalaka finds that his role as a manager does not align well with his introverted personality. This misalignment causes stress and frustration, as being a manager typically requires more extroverted behaviors. Over time, this mismatch could lead to burnout or dissatisfaction if not properly addressed.</p>
