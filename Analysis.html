					<!-- Issues Details -->
					<h2>MYDAD</h2>
					
					<h3>Workplace Issues</h3>
					<div class="issue-details">
					    <h4>Salary Dissatisfaction</h4>
					    <p>Although MYDAD is overall happy with his work, one thing he expressed dissatisfaction with was his salary. He stated, “The salary could be better.” As a result of salary dissatisfaction MYDAD could be willing to look for new work with higher pay despite being overall happy with other aspects of his job. This could mean higher turnover rates for the company if other employees are feeling the same.</p>
					
					    <h4>Work Exhaustion</h4>
					    <p>One of MYDAD’s priorities with work is to produce high-quality work. One of the things that can prevent him from doing this is the exhaustion from his work. MYDAD spoke on how the nature of his work can be very exhausting and how being in a bad mood due to exhaustion can push you over the edge and result in low-quality output.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Effective Practices</h3>
					<div class="practices-details">
					    <h4>Recognition and Awards (R&A)</h4>
					    <p>R&As were incentives in the form of cash and other benefits to acknowledge and reward employees and intern motivate them to do a good job. This recognition system helps to combat the problems employees face and reinforces good behaviors.</p>
					
					    <h4>Supportive Environment</h4>
					    <p>MYDAD’s work environment is structured in a way where employees are made to have a sense of community with one another. By fostering mutual common ground between employees, the sense of community created reduces stress and enhances job satisfaction. MYDAD stated, “Everyone wants to do a good job and get the work done so they can have more time for their personal values.”</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Vic</h2>
					<h3>Workplace Issues</h3>
					<div class="issue-details">
					    <h4>Low Job Satisfaction</h4>

Vic goes on to speak about how his work is not on the level he expected and criticizes his boss for his outdated managerial practices.</p>
					
					    <h4>Lack of Intrinsic Motivation</h4>
					    <p>Vic’s low job satisfaction is one of the big reasons for his next big workplace issue, his lack of intrinsic motivation. The lack of intrinsic motivation shows how Vic doesn’t find his work engaging or meaningful to his purpose. Vic stated how his motivation to work is simply to “pay the bills. “ Purely an external motivation.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Effective Practices</h3>
					<div class="practices-details">
					    <h4>Teamwork and operational efficiency</h4>
					    <p>When asked about his team Vic said his team functions smoothly because of the support from the leaders. Despite Vic's dissatisfaction with his work, his workplace encouraging collaboration and fostering positive team dynamics leads to continued effective practice.</p>

					</div>
						
					<h3>Effective Practices</h3>
