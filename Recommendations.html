							<h3>Performance Management</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pm1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Performance management is a process that is used to change the outcomes of the work environment. This can improve many things for a company such as job satisfaction and the quality of work. Performance management's components are defining goals, monitoring, evaluating, and providing consequences. MYDAD has a strong relationship with his managers, but they could better support him by addressing his work exhaustion caused by the physical demands of his job. One recommendation is to implement total rewards, which include benefits, growth opportunities, and a motivating work environment. To achieve this, managers should revisit the performance management process to assess and monitor MYDAD's work progress. They can identify the root cause of his exhaustion, whether internal or external and provide constructive feedback through private discussions while actively listening to his concerns. Finally, they can implement measures such as longer breaks or paid time off to help alleviate his fatigue. These steps would improve MYDAD’s job performance while preserving the strong relationship between him and his managers</p>
							<h3>Leadership</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/leadership.jpg" alt="" /></span>Vic is frustrated with his manager’s outdated techniques that emphasize fear over communication. To address this, HR should guide the manager toward transformational leadership, particularly individualized consideration, which builds trust through support and empowerment. HR can assess managers’ behaviors and provide guidance to enhance these skills. Vic’s manager should focus on understanding employees’ needs, giving constructive feedback, framing mistakes as learning opportunities, and fostering personal connections through one-on-one conversations. This shift would improve communication and create a more supportive work environment.</p>
							<h3>Organizational Culture</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/culture.jpg" alt="" /></span>Boomshakalaka's organizational culture aligns with the clan culture, emphasizing collaboration, trust, and support. To further strengthen employee relationships and enhance communication, introducing elements of adhocracy culture—focused on innovation and creativity—is recommended. Managers can model innovative behavior to inspire employees and provide opportunities for workers to exercise creative control over their tasks. Over time, these practices will foster adaptability and enhance the workplace culture, blending collaboration with a dynamic and creative environment.</p>
							<h3>Job Rotation</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rotation.jpg" alt="" /></span>To help Vic find meaning in his work and boost his motivation, implementing a job rotation program is recommended. This would allow him to explore different roles within his department, helping him identify a position that aligns with his values and interests. A rotational program could be designed to include three to five manufacturing areas over three to six months. Upon completion, managers could assess performance and discuss with employees to place them in roles they enjoy and excel in, ultimately enhancing job satisfaction and performance.</p>
							<h3>Total Rewards System</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/reward.jpg" alt="" /></span>Several interviewees expressed dissatisfaction with their salaries, which impacts motivation and increases turnover risk. To address this, implementing a total rewards system is recommended. This approach combines monetary and non-monetary benefits to boost motivation by offering value beyond salary. Employees can share their preferences through surveys or direct communication with managers, enabling the creation of tailored non-monetary rewards such as discounts at local restaurants, wellness programs, or child-care assistance. This ensures employees feel valued and supported, enhancing job satisfaction and retention.</p>
